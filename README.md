Tired of useless talking artifacts, Manta Rays flying through your buildings, or having to manually mine rocks on top of nodes? Well then this mod is right for you! It is a configurable mod that removes:

* Alien Artifacts

* Manta Rays

* Deposits

* Stingers (Spiders)

* Gas (Note: The gas particles will still be visible but it will not hurt the player)

* Gas Plants/Rocks

* <b>You can configure which of these you want to be removed in the main menu config file.</b>

Once an object is removed in a save file it's gone for good. And if you want to remove the mod at any point you can do so without issue since the mod does not modify any base game files.
