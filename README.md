Tired of useless talking artifacts, Manta Rays flying through your buildings, or having to manually mine rocks on top of nodes? Well then this mod is right for you! It is a configurable mod that removes:

* Alien Artifacts (Replaced with yellow power slugs for balancing)

* Manta Rays

* Deposits

* Stingers (Spiders)

* Gas (Note: The gas particles will still be visible but it will not hurt the player)

* Gas Plants/Rocks

* Fluffy-Tailed Hogs

* Baby Crabs/Hatches

* Plasma Spitters

* Destructible Rocks

* Space Giraffe-Tick-Penguin-Whale Thing

<b>NOTE: All scripts are disabled by default until you enable the ones you want in the Main Menu under Mod Configs -> Remove All Annoyances</b>

Once an object is removed in a save file it's gone for good. And if you want to remove the mod at any point you can do so without issue since the mod does not modify any base game files.
