This is a mod for Satisfactory that removes annoying creatures and objects that is also highly configurable. The source code here is free to use for your own projects, though I'd prefer if you didn't just redistribute the mod.

Jetbrains has provided me a free copy of their software for developing my mods, so huge thanks to them! You can check out their software here: https://www.jetbrains.com, or get a free copy for your open-source projects here: https://www.jetbrains.com/community/opensource
